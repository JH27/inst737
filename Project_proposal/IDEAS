1. See if the score of a post is in consistency with the comment by analyzing content of comment.

2. how about predicting question topic (e.g. tech-related question VS non-tech related question) by linguistic characteristics 
(e.g. how long a question is, how long an answer is, or TF/IDF score of a question)?

3. train a model to find labels for tech-related questions VS non-tech related questions so that it could be used to predict 
if a question is tech or non-tech. --bag of words model

4. Analyze content of posts, get the most frequently used words for different question topics (for example, 'machine learning',
'SQL', 'statistics'), then train a model to predict further questions to see if they can be categorized into a certain topic.
--->maybe related to tags too




Questions:
1. if a post can have only one comment? -- data in comment shows that one postID only has one comment but I see a post can have 
several comments on StackOverflow.
2. Should we do something about scores in comment? It seems most people ignored this part so most data in that column shows 0.
