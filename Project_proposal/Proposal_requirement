 There are many different avenues to create a successful project:
Analyze a dataset
Create annotations for a dataset
Create a classifier for a problem that interests you
Create a regression for a problem that interests you
Create an unsupervised analysis of a dataset
There are many other possible topics you could tackle.  Talk to me or discuss possible ideas on Piazza.  Make sure that it represents a reasonable amount of work (I expect more from larger groups), but don’t select something that is dissertation-sized.

Write a Project Proposal

On Oct 20 (April 14 for Spring), you’ll need to turn in a project proposal.  This 2-3 paragraph post should describe:
Who is in your group
What you will do
Where you will get the data
Who will do what
How do you know that what you did worked
What you’ll turn in for your midterm deliverable (more later)
