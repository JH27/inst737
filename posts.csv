"31133870","1","40365282","","2015-06-30 09:00:22","","3","758","<p>First of all I'm not actually sure if this belongs to CrossValidated or to StackOverflow. I'm sorry if I posted this Question on the wrong site.</p>

<p>I'm comparing several datasets against an observational dataset using R. Each of these has about 10 million continuous float values (the length of the data vector is not exactly the same for each dataset).</p>

<p>I usually calculate the <strong>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</strong> statistic using the <code>ks.test()</code> function from the standard <code>stats</code> package, but now I'm especially interested in the extreme values of the distributions. The KS, as far as I understand, pretty much hides those. The same happens for the <strong>Kullback-Leibler</strong> (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).</p>

<p>The <strong>Anderson-Darling</strong> test, on the other hand, is weighted to take into account the extremes of the distributions. However, I've not been able to find a simple implementation of the AD test that works on just two vectors as input (as <code>stats::ks.test()</code> does by just issuing <code>ks.test(obs.data, mod.data)</code>, where the two inputs are simple vectors), and neither I've been able to understand how to adapt my data to the functions I've tried.</p>

<p>I've taken a look at the following functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>cvm.test()</code> from package <code>dgof</code>, with option <code>type=""A2""</code>: requires a distribution as second input, not a vector</li>
<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>truncgof</code>: requires a distribution as second input</li>
<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>goftest</code>: as above</li>
<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>ADGofTest</code>: as above</li>
<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>kSamples</code>: in this case it's not clear to me what the output represents, and how I could normalize it, since it seems it's heavily dependent on the number of samples</li>
<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>nortest</code>: only tests for normality</li>
<li><code>ADbootstrap.test()</code> from package <code>homtest</code>: this seems quite different from a standard AD test</li>
</ul>

<p>None of the above, in short, can be used as simply as the standard <code>ks.test()</code> function or as the Kullbach-Leibler function <code>KLdiv</code> from package <code>flexmix</code> (which accepts a matrix of density values).</p>

<p>How can I calculate the AD statistic between two distributions provided simply as two vectors of continuous data, using R?</p>

<p>Click <a href=""http://solvedstack.com/questions/running-google-maps-v2-on-the-android-emulator"" rel=""nofollow"">solvedstack.com/questions/running-google-maps-v2-on-the-android-emulator</a></p>

<p>I have successfully run our app, which requires Google Maps API 2, on an AndroVM virtual machine.</p>

<p>AndroVM does not come with Google Maps or Google Play installed, but provides a modified copy of the Cyanogen Gapps archive, which is a set of the proprietary Google apps installed on most Android devices.</p>

<p>The instructions, copied from the AndroVM FAQ:</p>

<p>How can I install Google Apps (including the Market/Play app) ?</p>

<p>Download Google Apps : gapps-jb-20121011-androvm.tgz [basically the /system directory from the Cyanogen gapps archive without the GoogleTTS app which crashes on AndroVM]
Untar the gapps…tgz file on your host – you’ll have a system directory created
Get the management IP address of your AndroVM (“AndroVM Configuration” tool) and do “adb connect x.y.z.t”
do “adb root”
reconnect with “adn connect x.y.z.t”
do “adb remount”
do “adb push system/ /system/”
Your VM will reboot and you should have google apps including Market/Play.</p>

<p>You won’t have some Google Apps, like Maps, but they can be downloaded from the Market/Play.
So follow those instructions, then just install Google Maps using Google Play!</p>

<p>Some great side effects of using a VM rather than the emulator:</p>

<p>Vastly superior general performance
OpenGL acceleration
Google Play support
The only bump in the road so far has been lack of multi-touch gestures, which is a bummer for a mapping app! I plan to work around this with a hidden UI mechanism, so not such a huge problem.</p>

<p>I'm encountering some strange behaviour however, as demonstrated here:</p>

<pre><code>ssh $USER@$SERVER 'rm ~/backup.tar'

tar -xvzf backup.tar
cd backup
</code></pre>

<p>When I copy all of that and paste it into a terminal, the SSH command is executed, resulting in a pause as it runs. Once it finishes, the <code>tar</code> and <code>cd</code> commands are not executed - as if they were never copied.</p>

<p>I surmise this is because they're somehow being ""typed"" (I know that's not the right word) while the SSH command is still executing, and are hence consumed by that command - doing nothing there.</p>

<p>Sure, that makes sense, but it gets weird here:</p>

<pre><code>ssh $USER@$SERVER 'rm ~/backup.tar' &lt;&lt;EOF
EOF

tar -xvzf backup.tar
cd backup

<p>This seems like the same thing but with some random, purposeless heredoc. However when I've got it there, the <code>tar</code> and <code>cd</code> commands are successfully pasted and executed after the SSH command completes.</p>

<p><strong>And so my question:</strong></p>

<p>What difference did the heredoc make that caused <code>tar</code> and <code>cd</code> to be pasted as I would've originally expected?</p>

<p>Is there a better way than randomly slugging on a heredoc to achieve the same result?</p>

<p>If you just want to access the owner's email address from a <code>Car</code> instance you don't need to add it as a field on the <code>Car</code> model, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>my_car = Car.objects.get(owner=me)
my_email = my_car.owner.email
</code></pre>

<p>This does two seperate db queries, the first to get the <code>Car</code> and the second to get the owning <code>User</code> when you access the ForeignKey.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid this you can use <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/querysets/#select-related"" rel=""nofollow""><code>select_related</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>my_car = Car.objects.select_related().get(owner=me)
my_email = my_car.owner.email
</code></pre>

<p>Now it's only one query, Django knows to do a join in the underlying SQL.</p>

<p>But, assuming you know all this and you still really want to add the owner's email to the <code>Car</code> model. This is called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization"" rel=""nofollow"">'denormalisation'</a> and there can be valid performance reasons for doing it.</p>

<p>One problem that arises is how to keep the email address in sync between the <code>User</code> and <code>Car</code> models. If you are deliberately pursuing denormalisation in your Django app I highly recommend you consider using <a href=""http://initcrash.github.io/django-denorm/"" rel=""nofollow"">django-denorm</a>. It installs triggers in the SQL db and provides a nice interface for specifying denormalised fields on your model.</p>

<p>But since you are removing elements from the array, you may have a smaller array while computing this thing. So if you want to access the fifth and last element and you removed an element before, col will no longer have 5 elements. I suggest you loop backward on your coloumn, like this</p>

"31133921","1","","","2015-06-30 09:02:57","","3","119","<p>The other day I had a problem that was kind of interesting. It concerns scheduling a series of ""tournaments"". The following are the constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are 7 teams named A, B, ..., G</li>
<li>A tournament contains 3 teams, all teams in a tournament plays 1 game against the other 2 teams. I.e. a tournament consists of 3 games</li>
<li>Each team hosts two tournaments</li>
<li>Each team travels to four tournaments beside the tournaments they host</li>
<li>When the series is done all teams should have played all other teams twice</li>
</ul>

<p>Each travel is associated with a distance. The goal is to find a schedule such that the difference between the shortest and the longest travelling team is minimal.</p>

<p>Not exactly a traveling-salesman problem, but sort of related. I'll be happy to remove that tag if there are strong opinions against it.</p>

<p>Some sample data:</p>

<pre><code>create table d
(   source      varchar(20) not null
,   destination      varchar(20) not null
,   distance    int not null
,       primary key (source, destination) );

insert into d (source, destination, distance)
select 'A', destination, distance
from (values  ('B',204)
          ,   ('C',31)
          ,   ('D',185)
          ,   ('E',213)
          ,   ('F',142)
          ,   ('G',165)
     ) T(destination, distance);

insert into d (source, destination, distance)
select 'B', destination, distance
from (values ('C',230)
        ,    ('D',102)
        ,    ('E',169)
        ,    ('F',152)
        ,    ('G',224)
     ) T(destination, distance);

insert into d (source, destination, distance)
select 'C', destination, distance
from (values ('D',200)
            ,('E',224)
            ,('F',157)
            ,('G',135)
     ) T(destination, distance);

insert into d (source, destination, distance)
select 'D', destination, distance
from (values ('E',68)
            ,('F',51)

insert into d (source, destination, distance)
select 'E', destination, distance

        ,    ('G',88)
     ) T(destination, distance);

insert into d (source, destination, distance)
select 'F', destination, distance
from (values   ('G',80)
     ) T(destination, distance);

create view dv as
select source, destination, distance from d
union all
select destination, source, distance from d;
</code></pre>

<p>I started out with the assumption that it would be easiest to pick 4 travels for each team and filter from there. Let's call this relation team_travel. By cross-joining A's team_travels with B's team_travel etc we get all possible combinations of team_travels. From there we can exclude those that does not contain exactly 4 'A', 4 'B', etc. By ordering what remains with the difference of the greatest and the least travel distance we can get the result.</p>

<p>This is butt-ugly and can certainly be improved:</p>

<pre><code>create or replace function cnt_occ(s varchar(28), c varchar(1))
returns int
    return values length(s) - length(replace(s,c,null));

"31133924","1","","","2015-06-30 09:03:06","","1","107","<p>I'm coding a program with a typical main window GUI interface with the <code>QMainWindow</code> and <code>QMdiWindow</code> Qt 5.4 classes similar to the one of the below picture (from the <a href=""http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-mainwindows-mdi-example.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official documentation</a>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w8PGG.png"" alt=""Qt MDI""></p>

<p>Every time the active subwindow changes the <code>updateWindowMenu()</code> method is called and it clears and repopulates the <code>Window</code> menu with <code>QActions</code> pointing to one of each subwindows, that is it, when you click an action the subwindow associated with this action will be brought to the front and will become the active subwindow. The association is done with <code>QSignalMapper</code> because <code>updateWindowMenu()</code> needs the current active subwindow (if any).</p>

<p>The problem arises when I click an action, its signal is not triggered and hence the subwindow associated is not brought to the front. After investigating I realised that what hampers the action triggering is the call to <code>menuWindow-&gt;removeAction(mySubwindowActions-&gt;at(n))</code> (<code>menuWindow</code> comes from an <code>.iu</code> file created with Qt Designer). That is it, if I comment out</p>

<pre><code>// for (int n=0; n&lt;mySubwindowActions-&gt;size(); ++n)
//    menuWindow-&gt;removeAction(mySubwindowActions-&gt;at(n));
</code></pre>

<p>duplicated actions to the <code>Window</code> menu will be added every time <code>updateWindowMenu()</code> is called but they will work as expected and they will bring to the front the associated subwindow.</p>

<p>Why this anomalous behaviour? How can I remove actions without hindering the normal working of new added actions?</p>

<p>I have a list of 100 drugs. Each has a name, each has a URL associated with it, and each is in a section from 1-8. I need to create a list of the drug names in a table view. When a specific drug is selected, the drug name, its section and its URL need to be passed to another view controller.</p>

<p>I know how to implement all the gubbins to pass to another controller, set up table views etc I just dont know how to organise the data in a plist file so it can be accessible within the program and how to keep each drug linked to its URL and section. </p>

Facebook's Graph API secures protected endpoints by requiring that an <code>access_token</code> be passed in. The PHP SDK abstracts this away, but I have never been comfortable with Facebook handling the information because sometimes <em>it just doesn't work</em>. This isn't to say that the library is bad, but only that <strong>I haven't been using it correctly</strong>. Keep this caveat in mind.</p>

<p>It looks like you're working with a Facebook Canvas App. When the user successfully authenticates for the first time, Facebook will send an <code>access_token</code> in <code>$_GET</code>. At this point, you <em>should</em> save this to your database, since that access token is good for 3 months or so.</p>

<p>At the point, from then on, you can pass in the <code>access_token</code> in the call parameters:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    $user_profile = $facebook-&gt;api('/me', 'POST', array(
        ""access_token"" =&gt; ''    // access token goes here
    ));
} catch (FacebookApiException $e) {
    // error handling
}
</code></pre>

<p>Given that Facebook is returning the error that you need an access token in order to call the <code>/me</code> resource, it looks like <code>$facebook-&gt;getUser();</code> is returning something. You may want to double-check what it is.</p>

<hr>

<p>While I'm here, you're using this logic:</p>

<pre><code>if (!conditional) {
    // do something
}
if (conditional) {
    // do something else
}
</code></pre>

<p>Confusing. Use <code>else</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (conditional) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}

<p><strong>Question: short Version:</strong></p>

<p>How many possible categories (with subcategories) can Joomla 2.5 handle on a shared host. Which problems do I have to expect?</p>

<p><strong>Question: long Version:</strong></p>

<p>I m building an website for architects. The content structure looks like this</p>

<pre><code>HOUSES
    Architect A
      Project 1
      Project 2
      ...

    Architect B
      Project 1
      Project 2
      ...

Places
    Architect C
      Project 1
      Project 2
      ...

    Architect D
      Project 1
      Project 2
      ...
</code></pre>

<p>And so on. The most obvious would be to have HOUSES  and PLACES as Categories. Architect A, Architect B ... as subcategories and the Projects as articles. This would on the one hand keep the ability to use Joomlas Blog View etc. and not use third party CCK extensions but on the other hand this would probably cause 300 and more categories.</p>

<p>I figured out what is the problem but I don't know how to solve it. The problem is that there is no any <code>2.0/</code> directory in the <code>mysql2-0.3.11-x86-mingw32</code> gem. This is the gem that <code>rails</code> installs as its dependency from <strong>Gemfile</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>GEM
  remote: https://rubygems.org/
  specs:

     mysql2 (0.3.11-x86-mingw32)

<pre><code># C:\Ruby200\lib\ruby\gems\2.0.0\gems\mysql2-0.3.11-x86-mingw32\lib\mysql2\mysql2.rb

RUBY_VERSION =~ /(\d+.\d+)/
require ""mysql2/#{$1}/mysql2""  # &lt;&lt;-- this is that #2 line that throws an error
</code></pre>

<p>It is obvious that it takes the current Ruby version number and uses it as the path segment to reach some <code>mysql2</code> file. In fact it is <code>mysql2.so</code> file. As I use <strong>Ruby 2.0.0</strong> the path segment is <code>2.0</code>:</p>

<pre><code>mysql2/2.0/mysql2
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, now lets see how that directory of <code>mysql2-0.3.11-x86-mingw32</code> gem looks like:</p>

<pre><code>dir: C:\Ruby200\lib\ruby\gems\2.0.0\gems\mysql2-0.3.11-x86-mingw32\lib\mysql2\
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k0Ps8.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>No any <code>2.0/</code> directory.</p>

<p>I know the issue about <strong>libmysql.dll</strong>. I have it in my <code>C:\Ruby200\bin</code>. It doesn't help.</p>

<p>I read this answer <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/5368767/1114926"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/5368767/1114926</a> from the creator of RubyInstaller. I tried but it didn't help.

<pre><code>Uncaught Error: Invalid value for property &lt;origin&gt;: [object Object]

<p>How can I bind an event to the buttons inside the InfoWindow and still call recalcRoute?
I also tried to set <code>onclick</code> on the buttons, but the reference to recalcRoute is unknown.</p>

<p>Why is <code>$('#infoWindow button').on('click',function(){ console.log('test'); });</code> not working?</p>

As it is currently, you are attempting to bind a process to the same port three times - once in your for loop, and one time each for the two threads you start up. I'm not entirely sure why you are starting up three server processes, but you will want to revisit your design and make sure you are only binding the server port once.</p>

<p>What I would do is remove the try/catch logic from the main method, and spawn just <strong><em>one</em></strong> thread:</p>

If it's the 32bit version of Java, it will attempt to load any DLL as 32bit DLL, if it's the 64bit version of Java, it will attempt to load any DLL as 64bit DLL.</p>

<p>So, either
- You only have the 32bit Java installed on your system, and try to load a 64bit DLL; or
- You have both 32bit and 64bit Java installed, then you need to make sure that you use the 64bit version for your test.</p>

<p>The fact that you claim you have successfully used the DLL from a different folder suggests the latter, so make sure the java executable you use is the 64bit version.</p>

<ul>
<li>Checkbox </li>
<li>Textview </li>
<li>Text Field</li>

<p>This is fine in Android 4.0+, because the theme we are using is Theme.Light so the background color of the dialog is white and the default text is black for the Checkbox label and textview. However, in 2.3.3, the background color is dark grey so it becomes hard to see the text... the theme is still Theme.Light however.</p>

<p>I thought that making a custom dialog would be necessary for this because the checkbox enable/disables the text field. At the moment, I'm making the background color of the relativelayout for this Dialog white... but I don't really like this solution as there maybe cases where some other phones on 2.3.3 may not have white as the default dialog background...</p>
