JP found another politeness tool: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/politeness/vignettes/politeness.html 
   has been experimenting with it but hit a wall. He wil try to contact the writers of the tool for more clarification.
   But in the meantime, will go back to explore the Stanford API politeness tool that we found in the first place.
   Will try to finish it by the end of this week
   
JP will run the html strip code on the test data and provide the results to all/upload teh results since some are having 
problems installing the package due to java.
