       "'<p>First of all I\\'m not actually sure if this belongs to CrossValidated or to StackOverflow. I\\'m sorry if I posted this Question on the wrong site.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m comparing several datasets against an observational dataset using R. Each of these has about 10 million continuous float values (the length of the data vector is not exactly the same for each dataset).</p>\\n\\n<p>I usually calculate the <strong>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</strong> statistic using the <code>ks.test()</code> function from the standard <code>stats</code> package, but now I\\'m especially interested in the extreme values of the distributions. The KS, as far as I understand, pretty much hides those. The same happens for the <strong>Kullback-Leibler</strong> (feel free to correct me if I\\'m wrong).</p>\\n\\n<p>The <strong>Anderson-Darling</strong> test, on the other hand, is weighted to take into account the extremes of the distributions. However, I\\'ve not been able to find a simple implementation of the AD test that works on just two vectors as input (as <code>stats::ks.test()</code> does by just issuing <code>ks.test(obs.data, mod.data)</code>, where the two inputs are simple vectors), and neither I\\'ve been able to understand how to adapt my data to the functions I\\'ve tried.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'ve taken a look at the following functions:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>cvm.test()</code> from package <code>dgof</code>, with option <code>type=\"A2\"</code>: requires a distribution as second input, not a vector</li>\\n<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>truncgof</code>: requires a distribution as second input</li>\\n<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>goftest</code>: as above</li>\\n<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>ADGofTest</code>: as above</li>\\n<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>kSamples</code>: in this case it\\'s not clear to me what the output represents, and how I could normalize it, since it seems it\\'s heavily dependent on the number of samples</li>\\n<li><code>ad.test()</code> from package <code>nortest</code>: only tests for normality</li>\\n<li><code>ADbootstrap.test()</code> from package <code>homtest</code>: this seems quite different from a standard AD test</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>None of the above, in short, can be used as simply as the standard <code>ks.test()</code> function or as the Kullbach-Leibler function <code>KLdiv</code> from package <code>flexmix</code> (which accepts a matrix of density values).</p>\\n\\n<p>How can I calculate the AD statistic between two distributions provided simply as two vectors of continuous data, using R?</p>\\n <p>since the HttpClient has been depreciated, you may try the following code with Asynctask (also note that we need to encode the address into URL) : </p>\\n\\n<pre><code>public class GeoCoding extends AsyncTask&lt;Void, Void, Void&gt; {\\n    private String address;\\n    private static final String TAG = GeoCoding.class.getSimpleName();\\n    JSONObject jsonObj;\\n    String URL;\\n    private String Address1 = \"\", Address2 = \"\", City = \"\", State = \"\", Country = \"\", County = \"\", PIN = \"\", Area=\"\";\\n    private  double latitude, longitude;\\n    HttpURLConnection connection;\\n    BufferedReader br;\\n    StringBuilder sb ;\\n\\n    public GeoCoding(String address){\\n        this.address = address;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getArea(){\\n        return Area;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void getAddress() {\\n        Address1 = \"\";\\n        Address2 = \"\";\\n        City = \"\";\\n        State = \"\";\\n        Country = \"\";\\n        County = \"\";\\n        PIN = \"\";\\n        Area =\"\";\\n\\n        try {\\n\\n            String Status = jsonObj.getString(\"status\");\\n            if (Status.equalsIgnoreCase(\"OK\")) {\\n                JSONArray Results = jsonObj.getJSONArray(\"results\");\\n                JSONObject zero = Results.getJSONObject(0);\\n                JSONArray address_components = zero.getJSONArray(\"address_components\");\\n\\n                for (int i = 0; i &lt; address_components.length(); i++) {\\n                    JSONObject zero2 = address_components.getJSONObject(i);\\n                    String long_name = zero2.getString(\"long_name\");\\n                    JSONArray mtypes = zero2.getJSONArray(\"types\");\\n                    String Type = mtypes.getString(0);\\n\\n                    if (!

However when I\\'ve got it there, the <code>tar</code> and <code>cd</code> commands are successfully pasted and executed after the SSH command completes.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>And so my question:</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>What difference did the heredoc make that caused <code>tar</code> and <code>cd</code> to be pasted as I would\\'ve originally expected?</p>\\n\\n<p>Is there a better way than randomly slugging on a heredoc to achieve the same result?</p>\\n <p>I have modified your code a little bit, and able to achieve what you need.

Because maybe you shouldn\\'t.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you just want to access the owner\\'s email address from a <code>Car</code> instance you don\\'t need to add it as a field on the <code>Car</code> model, you can do:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>my_car = Car.objects.get(owner=me)\\nmy_email = my_car.owner.email\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This does two seperate db queries, the first to get the <code>Car</code> and the second to get the owning <code>User</code> when you access the ForeignKey.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to avoid this you can use <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/querysets/#select-related\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>select_related</code></a>:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>my_car = Car.objects.select_related().get(owner=me)\\nmy_email = my_car.owner.email\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Now it\\'s only one query, Django knows to do a join in the underlying SQL.</p>\\n\\n<p>But, assuming you know all this and you still really want to add the owner\\'s email to the <code>Car</code> model. This is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization\" rel=\"nofollow\">\\'denormalisation\\'</a> and there can be valid performance reasons for doing it.</p>\\n\\n<p>One problem that arises is how to keep the email address in sync between the <code>User</code> and <code>Car</code> models. If you are deliberately pursuing denormalisation in your Django app I highly recommend you consider using <a href=\"http://initcrash.github.io/django-denorm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">django-denorm</a>. It installs triggers in the SQL db and provides a nice interface for specifying denormalised fields on your model.</p>\\n <p>Right now my app layout looks like <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/orzmwe02a0l4z77/IMG-1.jpg?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>I want it to look like <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/cdxxtunc0h43j6n/IMG-2.jpg?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>How can I achieve this ?

The association is done with <code>QSignalMapper</code> because <code>updateWindowMenu()</code> needs the current active subwindow (if any).</p>\\n\\n<p>The problem arises when I click an action, its signal is not triggered and hence the subwindow associated is not brought to the front. After investigating I realised that what hampers the action triggering is the call to <code>menuWindow-&gt;removeAction(mySubwindowActions-&gt;at(n))</code> (<code>menuWindow</code> comes from an <code>.iu</code> file created with Qt Designer). That is it, if I comment out</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>// for (int n=0; n&lt;mySubwindowActions-&gt;size(); ++n)\\n//    menuWindow-&gt;removeAction(mySubwindowActions-&gt;at(n));\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>duplicated actions to the <code>Window</code> menu will be added every time <code>updateWindowMenu()</code> is called but they will work as expected and they will bring to the front the associated subwindow.</p>\\n\\n<p>Why this anomalous behaviour?

I think I might cry if I dont sort it soon!</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks alot,</p>\\n\\n<p>Lucy</p>\\n <p>I personally find it easier to manage the <code>access_token</code> myself. Facebook\\'s Graph API secures protected endpoints by requiring that an <code>access_token</code> be passed in. The PHP SDK abstracts this away, but I have never been comfortable with Facebook handling the information because sometimes <em>it just doesn\\'t work</em>. This isn\\'t to say that the library is bad, but only that <strong>I haven\\'t been using it correctly</strong>. Keep this caveat in mind.</p>\\n\\n<p>It looks like you\\'re working with a Facebook Canvas App. When the user successfully authenticates for the first time, Facebook will send an <code>access_token</code> in <code>$_GET</code>. At this point, you <em>should</em> save this to your database, since that access token is good for 3 months or so.</p>\\n\\n<p>At the point, from then on, you can pass in the <code>access_token</code> in the call parameters:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>try {\\n    $user_profile = $facebook-&gt;api(\\'/me\\', \\'POST\\', array(\\n        \"access_token\" =&gt; \\'\\'    // access token goes here\\n    ));\\n} catch (FacebookApiException $e) {\\n    // error handling\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Given that Facebook is returning the error that you need an access token in order to call the <code>/me</code> resource, it looks like <code>$facebook-&gt;getUser();</code> is returning something. You may want to double-check what it is.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>While I\\'m here, you\\'re using this logic:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>if (!conditional) {\\n    // do something\\n}\\nif (conditional) {\\n    // do something else\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Confusing.

You can solve both problems using an HTML <code>data-</code> attribute.</p>\\n\\n<p>First embed the data in the HTML:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;input id=\"SubmitCommentsForBOQ\" type=\"button\" value=\"Comments\"\\n    data-item-code=\"&lt;%: item.ItemCode %&gt;\" /&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Instead of <code>onclick</code>, bind the event handler using jQuery only, and perform all the actions you need at once:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>$(\"#SubmitCommentsForBOQ\").click(function () {\\n    var itemCode = $(this).data(\\'itemCode\\');\\n    ShowCommentBox(itemCode);\\n});\\n\\n$(\"#SubmitCommentsForTwo\").click(function () {\\n    $(\"#hiddenBox\").show();\\n    var itemCode = $(this).data(\\'itemCode\\');\\n    ShowCommentBox(itemCode);\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Multiple handlers will execute in the order in which they are bound, so you could also do something like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>// happens first, but only for this specific button\\n$(\"#SubmitCommentsForTwo\").click(function () {\\n    $(\"#hiddenBox\").show();\\n});\\n\\n// happens for all buttons\\n$(\"input[data-item-code]\").click(function () {\\n    var itemCode = $(this).data(\\'itemCode\\');\\n    ShowCommentBox(itemCode);\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n <p>You can see your changelists using <code>svn status</code>.  If you just want the names, grep for the lines beginning <code>--- Changelist</code>, e.g.:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>svn status | grep \"^\\\\-\\\\-\\\\- Changelist\"\\n</code></pre>\\n <p>That is because <code>this</code> is scoped to <code>.myDiv .submit_btn</code> and inside of there, the textarea does not exist. Perhaps try <code>this.parentNode</code> as the scope.</p>\\n <p>You could simply set your purple to all elements, and then remove it from the 3 unwanted ones:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>element { background: purple }\\nelement:first-child, element:nth-child(2), element:last-child, element:nth-last-child(2) {\\n   background: none; /* or whatever you want as background for those */\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Thats imho much easier to read</p>\\n <p>In short words, what I try to accomplish:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>single InfoWindow on map, because of many markers</li>\\n<li>InfoWindow content attached to marker</li>\\n<li>InfoWindow opens on marker click => content from attached attribute</li>\\n<li>InfoWindow contains 2 buttons => set <em>start</em>, set <em>target</em></li>\\n<li>if <em>start</em> and <em>target</em> are set, calculate route</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>I tried a lot and it\\'s quite difficult to attach a handler to a button inside an InfoWindow.

As it is currently, you are attempting to bind a process to the same port three times - once in your for loop, and one time each for the two threads you start up.

The only question goes to what version of the JavaVM you are using. If it\\'s the 32bit version of Java, it will attempt to load any DLL as 32bit DLL, if it\\'s the 64bit version of Java, it will attempt to load any DLL as 64bit DLL.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, either\\n- You only have the 32bit Java installed on your system, and try to load a 64bit DLL; or\\n- You have both 32bit and 64bit Java installed, then you need to make sure that you use the 64bit version for your test.</p>\\n\\n<p>The fact that you claim you have successfully used the DLL from a different folder suggests the latter, so make sure the java executable you use is the 64bit version.</p>\\n <p>If I understand your problem, try this in your .htaccess file:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^player.mydomain.com$\\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://player.vimeo.com/$1 [R=permanent]\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>That will simply throw the filename and query-string requested to player.vimeo.com.</p>\\n <p>The issue here is that you are writing everything to Excel as a string, and Excel will store it as such.  On editing and pressing Enter, Excel will re-interpret the cell contents and may then store it differently.</p>\\n\\n<p>When you call <code>ToString()</code> on a <code>DateTime</code>, the default formatting is in the form DD/MM/YY HH:mm:ss, which is exactly what you are seeing in the resultant file.</p>\\n\\n<p>Dates in Excel are stored as numbers representing the number of days that have elapsed since 1900.

However, in 2.3.3, the background color is dark grey so it becomes hard to see the text... the theme is still Theme.Light however.</p>\\n\\n<p>I thought that making a custom dialog would be necessary for this because the checkbox enable/disables the text field.

       "\"p First of all I'm not actually sure if this belongs to CrossValidated or to StackOverflow I'm sorry if I posted this Question on the wrong site p p I'm comparing several datasets against an observational dataset using R Each of these has about 10 million continuous float values the length of the data vector is not exactly the same for each dataset p p I usually calculate the strong Kolmogorov Smirnov strong statistic using the code ks test code function from the standard code stats code package but now I'm especially interested in the extreme values of the distributions The KS as far as I understand pretty much hides those The same happens for the strong Kullback Leibler strong feel free to correct me if I'm wrong p p The strong Anderson Darling strong test on the other hand is weighted to take into account the extremes of the distributions However I've not been able to find a simple implementation of the AD test that works on just two vectors as input as code stats ks test code does by just issuing code ks test obs data mod data code where the two inputs are simple vectors and neither I've been able to understand how to adapt my data to the functions I've tried p p I've taken a look at the following functions p ul li code cvm test code from package code dgof code with option code type A2 code requires a distribution as second input not a vector li li code ad

code as above li li code ad test code from package code kSamples code in this case it's not clear to me what the output represents and how I could normalize it since it seems it's heavily dependent on the number of samples li li code ad test code from package code nortest code only tests for normality li li code ADbootstrap test code from package code homtest code this seems quite different from a standard AD test li ul p None of the above in short can be used as simply as the standard code ks test code function or as the Kullbach Leibler function code KLdiv code from package code flexmix code which accepts a matrix of density values p p How can I calculate the AD statistic between two distributions provided simply as two vectors of continuous data using R p p since the HttpClient has been

the 64bit version for your test p p The fact that you claim you have successfully used the DLL from a different folder suggests the latter so make sure the java executable you use is the 64bit version p p If I understand your problem try this in your htaccess file p pre code RewriteCond HTTP HOST player mydomain com RewriteRule http player vimeo com 1 R permanent code pre p That will simply throw the filename and query string requested to player vimeo com p p The issue here is that you are writing everything to Excel as a string and Excel will store it as such On editing and pressing Enter Excel will re interpret the cell contents and may then store it differently p p When you call code ToString code on a code DateTime code the default formatting is in the form DD MM YY HH mm ss which is exactly what you are seeing in the resultant file p p Dates in Excel are stored as numbers representing the number of days that have elapsed since 1900 To get this number you can call the code ToOADate code method p p See a href http msdn microsoft com en gb library system datetime tooadate aspx rel nofollow http msdn microsoft com en gb library system datetime tooadate aspx a p p With the data set as a code double code and an appropriate format string you should get the result you're hoping for p p The new MVC classes really aren't suited for out of the box use with the CMS They're usable if you're willing to maintain the extra code to do it p p strong The 3 1 installer uses the new MVC strong otherwise the best examples I know using the newer MVC are the tracker application which is the only large scale web application I've seen publicly use it and the Platform Pull Tester p p David Hurley is running a series in the Joomla Magazine a href http magazine joomla org issues issue mar 2013 item 1137 joomla 30 extension development series writing the core rel nofollow latest article a on using the new MVC but it isn't very far along just yet p p I have a custom DialogPreference Dialog that has its layout set out in a relativelayout that contains the following p ul li Checkbox li li Textview li li Text Field li ul p This is fine in Android 4 0 because the theme we are using is Theme Light so the background color of the dialog is white and the default text is black for the Checkbox label and textview However in 2 3 3 the background color is dark grey so it becomes hard to see the text the theme is still Theme Light however p p I thought that making a custom dialog would be necessary for this because the checkbox enable disables the text field At the moment I'm making the background color of the relativelayout for this Dialog white but I don't really like this solution as there maybe cases where some other phones on 2 3 3 may not have white as the default dialog background p p Is there a cleaner way to fix this problem p p I notice this person has the same problem a href https stackoverflow com questions 15065049 custom support dialog fragment
